-PAINTING MODUL-
  Module consists of main window, which generates primitive shaped elements (ellipses, rectangles, triangles, etc.) with different colors, locations and dimensions.
  At constant intervals, there is a new element added (drawn), which values are pseudorandom. 
  The element has to have a proper location and dimension, so it fits in the window.
  Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.
  Program has to save information about generated shapes to a file.
  
-DISPLAYING MODUL-
  It consists of a window, which reads information about shapes from a file and draws them in the window. 
  Generated image has to be the same as the one generated by painting module.
  Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.

-ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION-
  Modules are understood as two parts of an application. 
  It does not implicate necessity of using modules or packages available by Java language.
  Format of a saved file is determined by a student. One cannot use “Object Streams” classes.
