## **PAINTING MODUL**

  * Module consists of main window, which generates primitive shaped elements (ellipses, rectangles, triangles, etc.) with            different colors, locations and dimensions.
  * At constant intervals, there is a new element added (drawn), which values are pseudorandom. 
  * The element has to have a proper location and dimension, so it fits in the window.
  * Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.
  * Program has to save information about generated shapes to a file.

## **DISPLAYING MODUL**

  * It consists of a window, which reads information about shapes from a file and draws them in the window. 
  * Generated image has to be the same as the one generated by painting module.
  * Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.
  

## **ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION**

  * Modules are understood as two parts of an application. 
  * It does not implicate necessity of using modules or packages available by Java language.
  * Format of a saved file is determined by a student. One cannot use “Object Streams” classes.
